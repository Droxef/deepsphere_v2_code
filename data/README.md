# Datasets

Directory grouping datasets and preprocessing scripts.

## Instructions

1. Run `download_dataset.py` to download the dataset and preprocess the data if needed.
2. For the `cosmo` experiment, run `data_preprocess.py` to preprocess the full cosmological maps.

## Miscellaneous

* `cosmo`: you need to ask permission for the data first.
* `shrec17`: the download link does not seem to work anymore.
* `climate`: the full equiangular dataset is over 3 TB, beware before downloading it.
